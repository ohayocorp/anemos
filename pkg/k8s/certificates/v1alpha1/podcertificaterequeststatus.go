	// If the certificate signing request is denied, a condition of type "Denied" is added and this field remains empty. If the signer cannot issue the certificate, a condition of type "Failed" is added and this field remains empty.
	// Validation requirements:
	//  1. certificateChain must consist of one or more PEM-formatted certificates.
	//  2. Each entry must be a valid PEM-wrapped, DER-encoded ASN.1 Certificate as
	//     described in section 4 of RFC5280.
	// If more than one block is present, and the definition of the requested spec.signerName does not indicate otherwise, the first block is the issued certificate, and subsequent blocks should be treated as intermediate certificates and presented in TLS handshakes.  When projecting the chain into a pod volume, kubelet will drop any data in-between the PEM blocks, as well as any PEM block headers.

	// NotBefore is the time at which the certificate becomes valid.  The value must be the same as the notBefore value in the leaf certificate in certificateChain.
